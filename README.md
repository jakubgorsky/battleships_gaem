# battleships++

Remake of Battleship in C++ / OpenGL. Started as a hobby project, turned to be graduation project at uni.

# Idea

I wanted to try myself in OOP and create a game. But console-based was not an option. 
I've opted for Battleships, the famous board game in which you place and then try to sink your enemies' ships. 
This is a very simple basis for a project but it quickly turned out to be very challenging. As of now, there only exists the underlaying structure of the game as I am currently learning OpenGL (for curious people I have another repo for that very project)
to make it fully GUI and work as, well, a game.

# TODO

- GUI
- Mutex check (so that only one instance is running at one given time)
- "AI" - I'm putting it in quotation marks as this is going to be very primitive, random layout generator with random shooting patterns
- Checks for various methods
