# battleships++

Started as a hobby project, turned to be graduation project at uni. Remake of Battleship in C++ / ~~OpenGL~~ SDL2. Due to complexity of OpenGL and little time I didn't manage to learn enough about OpenGL to be comfortable writing this remake in OpenGL, hence switched to SDL2.

# Idea

I wanted to try myself in OOP and create a game. But console-based was not an option. 
I've opted for Battleships, the famous board game in which you place and then try to sink your enemies' ships. 
This is a very simple basis for a project but it quickly turned out to be very challenging. ~~As of now, there only exists the underlaying structure of the game as I am currently learning OpenGL (for curious people I have another repo for that very project)
to make it fully GUI and work as, well, a game.~~

I've managed to make the game. It lacks audio, menus, settings, proper AI, but is fully playable.

# TODO
Soon-ish:
- Audio
- Menus
- Proper AI
- an option to generate one for player

in the future:
- Making it OpenGL
- LAN multiplayer
- WAN multiplayer
- animations, particles - eye candy in general
- better textures
- different board sizes
- customizable ships
- themes
- different layouts
- whatever comes into my mind
